# DJ Set Curator

**AI-powered harmonic mixing engine for DJs**

## Vision
Automatically generate optimized DJ sets using:
- Harmonic key compatibility (Camelot wheel)
- BPM matching
- Energy progression
- Strategic crowd engagement (popularity-weighted peak placement)

## Project Status
🚧 **In Development** - Building incrementally

This project is being developed as a demonstration of:
1. Multi-step API orchestration
2. Durable workflow execution with Temporal
3. Real-world music industry data integration

## Roadmap
- [ ] Data collection (Spotify API integration)
- [ ] Harmonic analysis (Camelot wheel implementation)
- [ ] Set sequencing algorithm
- [ ] Temporal workflow migration
- [ ] Full explainability (transition justifications)

## Follow Along
